Your approach looks solid, Tanmoy, but here are a few suggestions to make it a bit more robust:

1. Fixing Typo in Field Name
In your original code, the field for group admins is named gropuAdmins, which seems like a typo. I suggest renaming it to groupAdmins for clarity and consistency.

javascript
Copy
Edit
groupAdmins: [{
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'User'
}]
2. Add isGroupChat Check When Updating Admins
When adding or removing admins, ensure that the chat is a group chat. This can help prevent adding admins to one-on-one chats accidentally.

For example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
if (chat.isGroupChat) {
  await Chat.findByIdAndUpdate(chatId, { $addToSet: { groupAdmins: newAdminId } });
}
3. Add Unique Validation for Admins (Optional)
You might want to prevent adding the same admin multiple times. This can be handled by using $addToSet (which you're already doing), but it’s worth keeping in mind.

You can also add a validation check when adding an admin to make sure they aren't already an admin:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const chat = await Chat.findById(chatId);
if (!chat.groupAdmins.includes(newAdminId)) {
  // Add admin
}
4. Ensure Group Chats Have at Least One Admin
When creating a group chat, you can enforce that at least one admin is assigned right away. This will ensure the group doesn't get created without an admin.

For example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const newChat = await Chat.create({
  chatName: "Group Chat",
  isGroupChat: true,
  users: [user1Id, user2Id],
  groupAdmins: [user1Id] // Set initial admin
});
5. Add lastModifiedBy for Admin Changes
You may want to track who made changes to the admin list for audit purposes. You can add a lastModifiedBy field to store the admin who made the change.

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
groupAdmins: [{
  userId: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User'
  },
  modifiedBy: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User'
  },
  timestamp: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  }
}]
Summary of Changes:
Fix typo in groupAdmins.
Add checks to ensure the chat is a group chat before modifying the admin list.
Optionally, add checks for unique admins or validation.
Ensure at least one admin is added when creating a group chat.
Optionally track changes to admins by storing who made the change.
